## Fundamental lines

### Nib width
The width of your broad-edged InputAdornment
This is the base measurement of your guidelines

### X-Height
The distance between the base line and the x-height
Illustrations:
  Line set with x-height line in red and the area greyed out

### Ascender height
The distance between the x-height and the ascender line
Measured in nib-widths

### Descender height
The distance between the baseline and the descender line
Measured in nib-widths

### Interlinear spacing
The distance between the descender line of one row and the ascender line of the row below it
Measured in nib-widths

## Slope and pen angle

### Letter slope
The slant of the letters
Letter slope is measured in degrees. Zero degrees (0°) is vertical, straight up and down. As the letter slope slants to the right, this increases. 10° is rotated clockwise from vertical. It's important to not that not all downstrokes with follow this angle. A lowercase "c" will have an invisible centerline that matches the letter slope, but because of the shape of the letter, the strokes themselves with not. Conversely, the main stroke of a lowercase "i" will match the letter slope.

### Distance between letter slope lines

### Pen angle
The angle of the flat edge of the nib in relation to the horizontal lines
Pen angle is measured in degrees. Zero degrees (0°) is horizontal, flat left to right. As the letter slope slants upwards, this increases. 10° is rotated counter-clockwise from horizontal.
While many styles strictly adhere to the pen angle, it's relatively common for styles or individual artist to manipulate the pen angle as they're writing for specific effect. See Bone (style ), for example.
Note that nibs are often made with a slight angle to facilitate writing. They are not generally exactly perpendicular to the handle of the pen. It's important to measure pen angle from the actual flat edge of the nib, not from how you're holding the pen in relation to the paper.

## Page size and margins

### Page height

### Page width

### Top margin

### Bottom margin

Generally made slightly larger than the other margins, to give the page balance.
