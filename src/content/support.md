## Why you should give me money

## How to give me money

### Give me a job
  I started this whole thing to change my work life for the better. Building this project has prepared me for an entry level coding job, so if you or someone you know is looking for a such a thing, please get in touch. I'd love to hear from you.

  When I started talking about this project to my friends and family (Hi, Mom (link to her work)), they almost universally asked "Are you going to sell it?" Obviously I haven't. It was important to me so I did it (See Why I Built This Tool). They way to monetize a project like this is not to force people to pay for it before they see how mind-bogglingly useful it is, it's to give it to the people you love, and then use it as a portfolio piece to show what you're capable of. And by you, I mean me.
