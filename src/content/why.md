# Why did I make this tool?

I decided to make X-height for three reasons:
  1. I wanted to learn to code. It is important to me to have work that sustains me, that I enjoy, and that serves a greater purpose in the world. I saw coding as a contender to meet those needs. I also have experience designing and testing digital tools to ensure they solve the problems they're intended to solve, and I wanted to learn to solve them myself. I'm hands on.
  2. I was tired of ruling out guideline sheets by hand. It's arduous, tedious, and error-prone. The utility of guidelines sheets for learning and practicing calligraphic styles is exceptional, which is why we do it in the first place. However, we live in the future, and computers are ideal for solving problems of this sort. The existing options fell short in a variety of ways, so I saw an opportunity.
  3. To give back to the calligraphy community that has given so much to me. I started working on this project at a difficult and transformative time in my life, the kind that opens doors as it burns the house down. Making this tool seemed like the beautiful center of a three part Venn diagram to stay optimistic in a time of destruction, give back to a community that had supported me during that time, and invest in my own future. Specifically, I wanted to support the magnificent Cora Pearl, my particular teacher and mentor, who's work teaching calligraphy has changed my life more than I can say. If you have an opportunity to take a class or commission a piece of work, I suggest you take it. The rest of the world is going to find out about her, and you might not be so lucky later.
